# calculator
### the objective of today is to create a simple calculator which can have only two operands at a time and 4 operations to do (+,-,*,/)
###  we input the numbers, it gives us a result,
### then we ask if we want to continue doing calculations with this result: y or n or e,
###  type'yes' to continue which will continue till we get the desired result, if we want to start a new calculator type 'n' and then the screen will be cleared and we will begin from the first step, if we type 'e' we exit the program altogether.
